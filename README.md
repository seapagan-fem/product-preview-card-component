## My process

Developed in on Linux with VSCode, using the [Live
Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)
addon for instant feedback.

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I tend to focus on Backend development, so this is my first attempt at trying to
accurately replicate a provided design (as opposed to designing from scratch)
and was a very interesting learning experience. I think I'll be doing more of
these! :)

*I also learned to be careful where you click on elements in Figma, you may
activate a drop shadow by accident, then implement it not realising its not
actually in the design!*

I belive the CSS and HTML could be tightened up, I'll come back later and look
at it with more experienced eyes. I'm open to suggestions!
